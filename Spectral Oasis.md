I have discovered an oasis of my cherished pains. I reflect upon my wounds on the silvery water. Sealed lacerations, forgiven charrings, decaying scars, searing pain; old and new. The skin on my face is barely untouched. Small scars that decorate my cheek, dwarfed by the fissures across my chest.

The water moves as I invade the limits of what it can show me, the further I obsess over the minute atomic details of my face the swifter its agitation becomes. Refracting waves begin to veil the visage of my face, from what I am able to discern; a pious gaze. That would be all the clemency my person has to offer, for when I intend to become gracious, my hands and voice disagree furiously.

The sun sets as I wonder the revolution of the stars I yearn to voyage for, and alongside it, the futility of the search for affection. The night captures the twilight once more and claims the crimson dome under its raven pigmented cloak. I stare back into the water, greeted by a far more luminescent sight; of great splendor.

My flesh has sublimated against the muttering of my weakness, now I see the roots within my tortured soul. A gleaming light that bleeds into the picturesque starscape at the edges; pursuing and retreating from a nebulously decorated darkness. The face emanates with raw, undiluted power, beautifully sublime, as it slowly evaporates.

I’ve lost my vision, and yet nothing has changed. I still know the future… And all the horrors… And all the sorrows… If only I had drowned below the shores of Pluto, than I may have found respite in death. My mind is aflame, why am I still here, so far away from the ideals of happiness? It seems my fate has clasped me so tightly that I simply cannot hope for the one thing that could change it… My soul returns to me, with mended wounds and a thicker girth. My body atom by atom binds back to my being. I am recalled back into the present.

Another wound, another battle, another war,  
‘Til I arrive at the night’s Plutonian shore.
