The perturbations of my emotional state awards itself to the turbulence of my mind and its contents. My memories, dreams, my future; all come and go in a psychic tide. I live and yet I do not, my sight lays upon myself, from afar and I become the tribunal of an insignificant Homo Sapien.

I read many histories, on many times and places; there is always more than one, for a singular place and time. A peculiar species I was born into. To intently recognize itself from others, and yet still seek to be alongside them in an amalgam of family and social structure. Perhaps I am not too well acquainted with the nature of my being, as I mistakenly assimilate myself wherever, whenever; and fail in surrounding myself with what I would like to evolve into.

There is nothing alike my termination, it stands far and gazes thus back in summoning. It calls the only one in the fabric of the future that can reach him, his past tense. Millennia passes and his eyelids gravitate to a well-deserved slumber, yet he does not falter for many more centuries to come. Perhaps he is so far in never assimilated, no man alive could live that long and thus he must be like no men. So, he must’ve devoured in equal parts artists, architects, engineers and craftsmen, for only their works linger many centuries long in this rotting universe.

It is true that my heart does not stand calm, it is true my mind is ravished by emotions, yet I am a gashing wind that tears apart walls of steeled concrete. In a hurricane of thoughts, though everything flings into one another I stand resolute at the center, hoping for those who will never arrive to tell me the right things I need to hear…

Hence, I will live forever, as a wind of destruction. I will find lavish all serenity and secure all the good things within it.

The music is my serenity, the gentle wind that brushes my shoulders is my **only hope**, the calling sky is my **only reason to live**.
