It is the second episode of droplets on a string. The sky adorns its pitch deep marine blue face as the sun prepares to banish the night along with its mares. I lie in my bed under two duvets wrapped around each other, somehow managing to be less comfortable despite their soft touch. I awaken an hour before the dawn, summoned two hours earlier into the world than I should have been.

I feel a trembling in the air, the glass balcony door creaks as my brain swells against an unnatural thirst. Yet I lie, silent like a corpse, waiting for the stars to save me.

My bladder draws me from my rest onto my feet and I am dehydrated even further. I drink water and eat a tangerine, the first hints of sugar working to tear open my eyelids alongside the strange awakening that possesses me. I imagine something hugging me in a failed attempt to bring about my slumber once more.

There is many men in my hair and they’re mining my scalp. I begin to dig in alongside them, many strands of hair are harvested and disposed onto the ground to be cleaned. My head is desecrated, I feel filthy and unworthy of the personage I vesselize. I will rituate a purge against all stains in right order that I may be untouched by pestilence.

I wear dark, long-winded robes lined with crimson rims. I am _thin_, I want to become **flesh** and **bone**. I culminate into a smaller target, I transform into density. My soul retracted into a smaller volume, my mind can domineer over what’s left.

My hair peels away, my mind becomes more vulnerable with each tug. My brain can be touched now, and I do not bleed. The sky rots into brightness and my desire to surrender into waters becomes stronger. I will travel, carry my sacred form, and wrap layers of roses and nightshades around it.

Somewhere, there is an explosion. A light radiates with fury less than mine. It bursts into a point, then a sphere. It waits for me to see it, but I shall not.

_I burst into a point, then onto a world. The day begins._
