Foxhunt is a game where participants seek a radio transmitter within a given area using radio-seeking methods. A large area littered with three receivers constantly receive a radio signal from a single location. The participants are to locate the transmitter by triangulating from the three receivers.
# Overview
* Antenna construction and radiation patterns.
* Amplifier and attenuator design.
* RF band reflectors and absorption.
* Field activity and social connections.
## Trivia
Mountains can reflect radio patterns, which means an apparent radio source can be in actuality just a reflector. Such non-trivialities must be considered when foxhunting.
# Antenna Radiation Patterns
#emr #radiation #antenna
**The reception and the transmission strength of the antenna over a radiation pattern is equal.**
## Isotropic Antenna
#isotropism #isotropicantenna
Such antenna do not exist, they're ideal antennas that radiate equally in all directions. The strength of the signal is disproportionate with $r^{2}$ distance from the antenna tip.
## Omni-Directional Antenna
#omnidirectionalantenna
These antennas are closest to isotropic, such antenna radiate in a donut-like shape, the signal is strongest in the horizontal plane corresponding to the antenna's average height.

These antennas also have different types, **monopole**, **dipole**, and **helical** antennas.
## Directional Antenna
#directionalantenna #yagi-uda #parabolicantennas #hornantennas
Antenna whose design radiate waves in a single direction. This can be achieved by emitting the EMWs with different phases along a linear array, or just structuring the antenna such that the radiation along non-forward directions cancel out.

Television pan antennas are an example of this type of antenna. The sub-types are Yagi-Uda antenna, Parabolic Antennas, and Horn Antennas.
# Filtering and Processing
## Attenuator
#attenuator
An attenuator is an electronic device that reduces the power of a signal without appreciably distorting its waveform. Attenuators are usually passive devices made from simple voltage divider networks. Switching between different resistances forms adjustable stepped attenuators and continuously adjustable ones using potentiometers. For higher frequencies precisely matched low VSWR resistance networks are used.

Fixed attenuators in circuits are used to lower voltage, dissipate power, and to improve impedance matching. In measuring signals, attenuator pads or adapters are used to lower the amplitude of the signal a known amount to enable measurements, or to protect the measuring device from signal levels that might damage it. Attenuators are also used to 'match' impedance by lowering apparent SWR (Standing Wave Ratio).
## Amplifier
#amplifier
An amplifier, electronic amplifier or (informally) amp is an electronic device that can increase the magnitude of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). It is a two-port electronic circuit that uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude (magnitude of the voltage or current) of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output. The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its gain: the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input. An amplifier is defined as a circuit that has a power gain greater than one.
## Types of Modulation
### ASK Modulation
Amplitude-shift keying (ASK) is a form of amplitude modulation that represents digital data as variations in the amplitude of a carrier wave. In an ASK system, a symbol, representing one or more bits, is sent by transmitting a fixed-amplitude carrier wave at a fixed frequency for a specific time duration. For example, if each symbol represents a single bit, then the carrier signal could be transmitted at nominal amplitude when the input value is 1, but transmitted at reduced amplitude or not at all when the input value is 0.
