#timecomplexity
## Omega Notation - $\Omega(g(n))$
Represents the lower bound of an algorithm. This is the best-case scenario.
## Theta Notation - $\Theta(g(n))$
Represents both the upper bound and lower bound and therefore analyses the average case complexity of an algorithm.
## Big O Notation - $O(g(n))$
Represents the upper bound of an algorithm. This means the worst-case scenario for how the algorithm will perform.
# Master Theorem
#mastertheorem
The master theorem is a method used in algorithm analysis in order to derive the time complexities of recursive algorithms that employ a divide & conquer strategy.
