This is a series of notes that I created in college. It only contains the content that do not bear any copyrighted material.

Most of it is going to be incomplete -- this is because I do not have time to completely record my mind, nor do I have any interest in it.

The website is a learning project regarding Static Site Generators (SSGs); if my notes are of use to you, it unintended.
