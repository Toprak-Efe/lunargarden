Shadows that vored our eyes and the weights that bound us down, yet it is in the spirit of ascension we linger on. I myself have taken a particulate interest in artificing and the making of many things. Some days it is the end when others it is the means, yet I do the same very things. I transcribe knowledge, hoard it, experiment on it; reinvent it. The part of my journey where I will birth new atoms for the cauldron of our souls is not yet here.

All my efforts are in learning what those came before me already knew, though it needs to be said, this hasn't stopped me from making new kinds of the same things they crafted. I understand that everything takes time, and if I ever reach that terminal, it will be a very close call to instead have befallen by fate unto history forevermore. Death was always the enemy of men, but hardly that of the progress. It prays only on the former, and merely inconveniences the latter by a couple centuries at most.

I may die, yet it is the fate of every man's manifesto to be rediscovered, rewritten, and owned by somebody else; even if briefly. That is why I continue without too much worry, if I fail, someone else is bound to not. Perhaps a thousand years from now, I wish you fun with your newfound freedom-- regardless of your capacity to feel it.

It is not the mortality that troubles me, only the triviality of daily life. Bonds that I must keep a keen eye on the decay of, love which is always difficult to unearth lest granted, and finances that must be found bountiful for learning but enough to break even. My doctrine has been a simple matter, I would buy books even if is the last of my money; for in mastery we will find our nourishment. Starving early on is expected of us lower classes, yet with faith in our talent we can linger on to a more lavish age.

Sea of the management and the effort I swim in, I am slowly drifting towards my goals. Yet there are days where I find no motivation within; those days I need remember only to search it in my anger and madness. I am hardly short of those.

So I keep hurting in the waters made of **glass**, yet we are hardly allowed death-- for rest must be earned.
